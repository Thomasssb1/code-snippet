# Code Snippet

Generate simple screenshots of your code without even needing to WIN+SHIFT+S!
Snippets can be customised to your needing and will be consistent which can be especially useful when you are trying to make a well-stylised document.

Currently Code Snippet will only support:

- python
- java
- ruby
- dart

Out of the box, but you will be able to manually add them with a little bit of configuration. Don't worry if you don't think you know what you are doing - more languages will be supported soon.

## Manual support

If your language is not mentioned above, you can still use the tool but instead will have to input a styles.json file - a template is currently available in `config/styles.json`. It follows the [Visual Studio Code Semantic Highlight Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide#theming).

### Warning

This is currently under development and so currently only java works as intended. I am planning on adding the intended languages as mentioned previously, for now if you want to add any language look at [manually adding a language](#manual-support).
