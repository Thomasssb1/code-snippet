# Create python script to generate perfect screenshots of code snippets

- Select lines to generate snippet
- Custom syntax highlighting
- Checkbox to add errors/underlines (maybe)
- Use streamlit for UI
- Return image using PIL and download to system and show on screen (click to copy)
- Custom config styling file which will support a vscode styling app
- Support for specific languages (python, java, ruby, dart) but will add more at a later date - the user can also add their own style file which will accept any language, just that by default only specific languages will be supported without extra config
- UI to change the colour scheme
